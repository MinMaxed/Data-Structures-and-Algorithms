# Quick Sort

## Description
This is a quick sort algorithm that takes in an int array, and a left and right bound (0 and array.Length-1 to start).
It makes a pivot integer based on those bounds, and then compares and swaps all of the values based on if they are
less than or greater than the pivot. it recursively calls itself until everything has been sorted smallest
to largest.
