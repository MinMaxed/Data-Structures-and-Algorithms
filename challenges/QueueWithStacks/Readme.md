# Queue With Stacks

## Description
Using only a Stack's Push and Pop methods, this lab is simulating a Queue's First In First Out principle to make Enqueue & Dequeue methods. Enqueue takes the Top of a stack and Pops it off, where Dequeue will 'flip' a stack onto a second stack, to be able to pull off the first node that entered the stack/queue.
