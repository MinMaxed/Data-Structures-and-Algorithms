# Stacks and Queues

Create your own technical documentation for your new implementation. 1. Explain to your audience what the data structure is (in your own words) 1. Visuals of what it looks like 1. How you implemented it 1. What type of uses you would use this for (provide 2 examples)



## Description
The data structures we are making are Stacks, which goes by the Last In First Out principle, is like a Pringles can. the ones at the bottom were put there first, and the only one you can ever take out is the last most one that was put into it. The methods available allow you to add on top of the stack, take from the top of the stack, or just look at the top of the stack. 


A Queue goes by the First In First Out principle, and is like waiting in line at the DMV. You get there, you get your number, you enter the back of the line, and once everyone who's number comes before you is done, then its your turn. The methods available allow you to add to the queue, remove whoever's at the front of the queue, and look at who's in the front of the line.
