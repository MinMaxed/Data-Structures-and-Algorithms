# Graphs

## Description
This is a data structure of connecting nodes into a graph, specifically an Adjacency List. You can add Nodes to the graph via making edges, get the graphs size, get all of the nodes in the graph, neighbors of a node, and traverse the graph. 
This application has a Breadth First traversal which is utilized in the Size and Get Nodes method. This application assumes there are no islands, and direction does not matter.
